The area of the semi-circle can be calculated by taking half of the area of the circle, which is equal to pi times the radius squared. Since the diameter of the semi-circle is equal to the length of side AD, which is 19 units, the radius is half of that, which is 9.5 units. Therefore, the area of the semi-circle is equal to 0.5 * pi * (9.5 units)^2 = 89.58 square units. To find the area of the ABCD shape, we subtract the area of the semi-circle from the area of the rectangle: 171 square units - 89.58 square units = 81.42 square units."

The area of an equilateral triangle is given by the formula (sqrt(3) / 4) times the length of one side squared. Since the height of the removed triangle is 15 units, the length of one side of the triangle is also 15 units. Therefore, the area of AED is (sqrt(3) / 4) times 15 units squared.

The diameter of the semi-circle is equal to the length of AD, which is 20 units. Therefore, CD = AB - 20 = 20 - 20 = 0 units. Since CD has a length of 0 units, the perimeter of the ABCD shape is equal to the sum of the lengths of AB, BC, and the circumference of the semi-circle. The circumference of a semi-circle is equal to half the circumference of a full circle, so we can calculate it using the formula C = \u03c0 * r, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. The radius is equal to half the length of the diameter, which is 10 units. Therefore, the circumference of the semi-circle is C = \u03c0 * 10 = 10\u03c0 units.

The circumference of a circle is given by the formula 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius. In this case, the radius is half the length of AB, which is 21/2 units. Therefore, the circumference of the semi-circle is 2\u03c0 * (21/2) units. To compute the perimeter of the shape, we add up the lengths of all its sides: AB + BC + CD + DA.

Since the arc length is given as 20.56 units, we can calculate the circumference of the circle by dividing the arc length by the angle in radians, which is 2 * pi. Therefore, the circumference of the circle is 20.56 / (2 * 3.14) = 3.27 units. Now, we can calculate the angle CBA by dividing the arc length by the circumference of the circle and then multiplying by 360 degrees. So, the angle CBA is (20.56 / 3.27) * 360 = 227.25 degrees. Rounded to 2 decimal places, the angle CBA is approximately 227.25 degrees."

In this case, the diameter AB is equal to the radius. By rearranging the formula, we can solve for the radius: r = sqrt((2 * area) / pi). Plugging in the given area of 25.12, we get r = sqrt((2 * 25.12) / 3.14) = sqrt(40.0646) = 6.33 (rounded to 2 decimal places). Therefore, the length of side AB is equal to the diameter, which is 2 times the radius, so AB = 2 * 6.33 = 12.66 (rounded to 2 decimal places)."

The lengths of sides AB, BC, and CD are given as 9 units, 6 units, and 9 units respectively. The circumference of the semi-circle can be calculated using the formula C = \u03c0d, where d is the diameter of the semi-circle. In this case, the diameter of the semi-circle is equal to the length of side AD, which is 9 units. Therefore, the circumference of the semi-circle is 3.14 * 9 = 28.26 units. The perimeter of the ABCD shape is equal to the sum of the lengths of sides AB, BC, CD, and the circumference of the semi-circle, which is 9 + 6 + 9 + 28.26 = 52.26 units."

The area of the semi-circle can be calculated by using the formula (\u03c0 * r^2) / 2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the length of AD is half the length of AB, the radius of the semi-circle is 8.5 units. Substituting the values into the formula, we get an area of approximately 113.04 square units.

By rearranging the formula, we can solve for the radius: radius = sqrt((area * 360) / (angle * pi)). Once we have the radius, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, BC is the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are the radius and the length of the arc AC. Therefore, BC^2 = radius^2 + (arc length)^2.

The radius of the semi-circle is equal to half the length of BC, which is 14 / 2 = 7 units. Substituting the values, we get the circumference of the semi-circle as 2 * 3.14 * 7 = 43.96 units.

Given that the value of pi is 3.14, we can rearrange the formula to solve for the radius r. By substituting the given area, we get (3.14 * r^2) / 2 = 25.12. Simplifying this equation, we find that r^2 = (25.12 * 2) / 3.14. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that r = \u221a((25.12 * 2) / 3.14).

The diagonal line divides the square into two congruent right triangles. Let's call the length of one side of the square 'x'. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have x^2 + x^2 = 12^2. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x^2 = 144. Dividing both sides by 2, we have x^2 = 72. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that x is approximately equal to 8. Therefore, the perimeter of the square ABCD is 4 times the length of one side, which is 4 times 8, equal to 32 units."
