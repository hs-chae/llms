Given that the length of side BC is 9 units, and the length of side CD is 6 units, we can calculate the length of side AB as follows: AB^2 = BC^2 - CD^2. Substituting the values, AB^2 = 9^2 - 6^2 = 81 - 36 = 45. Taking the square root of both sides, we get AB = \u221a45 \u2248 6.71 units, rounded to 2 decimal places."

The diagonal of a rectangle divides it into two congruent right triangles. So, using the Pythagorean theorem, we have AD^2 + AB^2 = AC^2. Given that the diagonal AC is 17, we can substitute the values and solve for AD. Therefore, the length of the side AD is sqrt(17^2 - 9^2), which is approximately 14."
