The points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O are positioned in a plane. The lines AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH, AI, AL, AM, AN, AO, BC, BN, BO, CN, CO, DB, DC, DF, DG, DH, DI, DL, DM, DN, DO, EB, EC, ED, EF, EG, EH, EI, EL, EM, EN, EO, FB, FC, FG, FH, FI, FL, FM, FN, FO, GB, GC, GH, GI, GL, GM, GN, GO, HB, HC, HI, HL, HM, HN, HO, IB, IC, IL, IM, IN, IO, JA, JB, JC, JD, JE, JF, JG, JH, JI, JL, JM, JN, JO, KA, KB, KC, KD, KE, KF, KG, KH, KI, KJ, KL, KM, KN, KO, LB, LC, LM, LN, LO, MB, MC, MN, MO, NO connect various combinations of these points. There are also three circles, with centers at points K, J, and C, and radii of 0.0, 1.0, and 12.0 respectively. The point E lies on the circle with center K and radius 0.0, the point D lies on the same circle. The point L lies on the circle with center J and radius 1.0. The points E and D both lie on the circle with center C and radius 12.0.
