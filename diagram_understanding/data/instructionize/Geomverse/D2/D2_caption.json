The adjacent angles BAC and BAD are complementary, meaning they add up to 90 degrees. To find the degree of the CBA angle, we can subtract the sum of the angles BAC and BAD from 180 degrees (since the sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees). So, the degree of the CBA angle can be computed by 180 - (90 + 20) = 70 degrees."

To compute the area of the shape ABCD, we need to calculate the area of the rectangle and the area of the semi-circle separately, and then add them together. The area of the rectangle is found by multiplying the length BC by the width AB. The area of the semi-circle is found by using the formula (1/2) * pi * r^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle. The radius can be found by dividing the length of side AD by 2. Once we have the areas of the rectangle and the semi-circle, we can add them together to get the total area of the shape ABCD."
