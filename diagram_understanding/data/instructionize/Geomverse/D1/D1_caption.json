The length of the AB side is given as 21 and the length of the BC side is given as 14. The perimeter of the ABCDE shape can be computed by adding the lengths of all the sides of the shape. To find the length of the AD side, we can subtract the length of the AB side (21) from the length of the BC side (14), which gives us 7. Since the ABCD shape is a rectangle, the length of the CD side is also 7. The length of the AE side can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the AE side, and the other two sides are the AD side (7) and the DE side (which is equal to the length of the AB side, 21). Therefore, we have AE^2 = 7^2 + 21^2, which gives us AE \u2248 22.91. The perimeter of the ABCDE shape can now be computed by adding the lengths of all the sides: AB + BC + CD + DE + EA = 21 + 14 + 7 + 21 + 22.91 \u2248 85.91.

The tangent of an angle is equal to the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. In this case, the opposite side is AC and the adjacent side is AB. So, we can calculate the tangent of the CBA angle as the ratio of 19 to 22. Using a calculator, we can find that the tangent of the CBA angle is approximately 0.8636. To find the degree of the angle, we can use the inverse tangent function. Taking the inverse tangent of 0.8636, we get approximately 40.56 degrees. Therefore, the degree of the CBA angle is approximately 40.56 degrees."

The square ABCD is symmetrical, with each side having the same length. To find the area of the square, we need to determine the length of one side. Since the diagonal divides the square into two congruent right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of one side. The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse (diagonal) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the diagonal is 12 units, so we have 12^2 = x^2 + x^2, where x represents the length of one side of the square. Simplifying this equation, we get 144 = 2x^2. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x^2 = 72. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that x is approximately 8.49 units. Now that we know the length of one side, we can compute the area of the square by squaring this length. The area of the square ABCD is therefore approximately 72 square units."

To compute the area of the ABCD shape, we need to find the area of the square and subtract the area of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the side of the square, the radius of the circle is half of the diameter, which is 3 units. The area of the square is found by multiplying the length of one side by itself, so the area of the square ABCD is 6 * 6 = 36 square units. The area of the circle is found by multiplying the radius squared by pi, so the area of the circle is 3.14 * 3 * 3 = 28.26 square units.

Since the diameter of the semi-circle is equal to the length of the AB side, the radius is half of that, which is 5. The circumference of the semi-circle is therefore 2\u03c0(5) = 31.4.

The equilateral triangle is attached to the side AD of the rectangle. To calculate the area of the ABCDE shape, we need to find the area of the rectangle ABCD and the area of the triangle AED and then add them together. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length of one of its sides by the length of an adjacent side. In this case, the area of the rectangle ABCD is 14 * 6 = 84 square units. The area of an equilateral triangle is calculated by taking the square root of 3 divided by 4 and multiplying it by the length of one of its sides squared. In this case, the length of one side of the equilateral triangle is 6 units. So, the area of the triangle AED is (\u221a3/4) * 6^2 = 9\u221a3 square units. Adding the areas of the rectangle and the triangle, the total area of the ABCDE shape is 84 + 9\u221a3 square units. To round this to 2 decimal places, we can use the approximation 1.73 for \u221a3.

Since we are given the arc length of 17.99 units, we can set up the equation 2\u03c0r = 17.99, and solve for r.

The parallelogram is a four-sided polygon with opposite sides that are parallel and equal in length. To compute the area of the ABCD parallelogram, we can use the formula A = base x height, where the base is the length of one of the sides and the height is the perpendicular distance between the base and the opposite side. In this case, the base is the length of the AB side, which is 7 units, and the height can be found by using trigonometry. By drawing a perpendicular line from point D to side AB, we can create a right triangle with the height as one of the legs. The angle DAB is given as 35 degrees, so we can use the sine function to find the height. The sine of an angle is equal to the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse, so sin(35) = height / 18. Solving for the height, we get height = 18 x sin(35) = 10.29 units. Now we can compute the area of the parallelogram by multiplying the base (7 units) by the height (10.29 units), giving us an area of 72.03 square units. Rounding this to 2 decimal places, the area of the ABCD parallelogram is 72.03 square units."

The length of the side BC is given as 7 units and the degree of the angle CBA is given as 65 degrees. To compute the arc length of the sector ABC, we need to use the formula for the circumference of a circle. The circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the radius is given by the length of the side BC, which is 7 units. So, the circumference of the circle is C = 2\u03c0(7) = 14\u03c0 units. To find the arc length of the sector ABC, we need to find the fraction of the circumference that the angle CBA represents. Since the angle CBA is 65 degrees, we can use the formula for finding the fraction of a circle that an angle represents, which is given by the formula fraction = angle/360. In this case, the fraction is 65/360 = 0.18. Finally, to find the arc length of the sector ABC, we multiply the fraction by the circumference of the circle. So, the arc length of the sector ABC is 0.18 * 14\u03c0 = 2.52\u03c0 units. Rounding to 2 decimal places, the arc length of the sector ABC is approximately 7.92 units."

Using a calculator, we find that arctan(9/11) is approximately 39.81 degrees. Therefore, the degree of the CBA angle is approximately 39.81 degrees."

The sector is a portion of a circle, where the arc length is the distance along the curved part of the circle between points A and C. To compute the arc length, we need to use the formula L = r\u03b8, where L is the arc length, r is the radius of the circle, and \u03b8 is the measure of the central angle in radians. In this case, we are given the length of side BC, which is the radius of the circle. To find the radius, we can use the formula r = BC/2. Using the given length of BC as 6 units, we can calculate the radius as 3 units. Next, we convert the degree measure of the angle CBA to radians by multiplying it by \u03c0/180. Thus, \u03b8 = 75\u00b0 * \u03c0/180 = 1.31 radians. Finally, we substitute the values of r and \u03b8 into the formula L = r\u03b8 and compute the arc length as L = 3 * 1.31 = 3.93 units. Therefore, the arc length of the ABC sector is 3.93 units, rounded to 2 decimal places."

The rectangle ABCD is symmetrical, with the side AB parallel to the side CD and the side BC parallel to the side AD. The semi-circle arc connects the points A and D, forming a curved boundary for the shape. To compute the area of the ABCD shape, we need to find the area of the rectangle ABDC and add the area of the semi-circle arc. The area of the rectangle ABDC can be calculated by multiplying the length of the side AB (13 units) by the length of the side BC (12 units). The area of the semi-circle arc can be calculated by using the formula for the area of a circle, which is \u03c0 times the radius squared, divided by 2. In this case, the radius of the semi-circle arc is half the length of the side BC, which is 6 units. Therefore, the area of the semi-circle arc is \u03c0 times 6 squared, divided by 2.

The length of the arc AC is equal to the circumference of the circle multiplied by the ratio of the angle CBA to 360 degrees. The length of the arc AC can be calculated using the formula: arc length = (angle/360) * 2 * pi * radius. Since the radius of the circle is not given, we cannot directly calculate the length of BC. However, we can use the formula for the area of a sector to find the radius. The area of the sector ABC is equal to (angle/360) * pi * radius^2. By rearranging the formula, we can solve for the radius: radius = sqrt((area * 360) / (angle * pi)). Once we have the radius, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, BC is the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are the radius and the length of the arc AC. Therefore, BC^2 = radius^2 + (arc length)^2.

To find the degree measure of angle CBA, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is 2\u03c0r, where r is the radius of the circle. Since we know the arc length and the radius, we can set up the equation 2\u03c0r = 23.13, and solve for r.

Since we need the degree measure of angle CBA, we can convert the central angle from radians to degrees by multiplying by 180/\u03c0.

In order to compute the area of the ABCD shape, we need to find the area of the square and subtract the area of the circle. To find the area of the square, we can use the formula A = s^2, where s is the side length. Since the length of AD is given as 20, we can assume that the side length of the square is also 20. Therefore, the area of the square is 20^2 = 400. To find the area of the circle, we can use the formula A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius. Since the diameter of the circle is given as 20, the radius is half of that, which is 10. Therefore, the area of the circle is 3.14 * 10^2 = 314. Finally, we can subtract the area of the circle from the area of the square to find the area of the ABCD shape: 400 - 314 = 86."

The perimeter formula for this shape is AB + BC + CD + DA + circumference of the semi-circle. Since BC is given as 12, we can substitute this value into the formula.

To find the area of the circle, we can use the formula A = \u03c0r^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the AD side, the radius is half of that, which is 10.5 units. Plugging this value into the formula, we get A = 3.14 * (10.5)^2. To find the area of the square, we can use the formula A = s^2, where s is the length of the side of the square. Since the AD side is given as 21 units, the area of the square is A = 21^2. Finally, we can find the area of the ABCD shape by subtracting the area of the circle from the area of the square: A_ABCD = A_square - A_circle."

The formula is C = 2\u03c0r, where C is the circumference and r is the radius of the circle. In this case, the arc AC is a portion of the circumference, so we can write C = 2\u03c0r * (60/360), where 60/360 is the fraction of the circle that the sector represents. We are given that the arc length AC is 20.56 units, so we can set up the equation 2\u03c0r * (60/360) = 20.56.
