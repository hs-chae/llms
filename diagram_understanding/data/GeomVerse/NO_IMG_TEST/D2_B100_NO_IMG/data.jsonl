The length of the other side of the rectangle is equal to the length of the side of the triangle and can be computed based on the height of the triangle as $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} * 7 = \\frac{2}{1.73} * 7 = 1.16 * 7 = 8.12$. So the area of the rectangle is $12.24 * 8.12 = 99.39$. The length of the height of the equilateral triangle is 7 and the length of the base was computed as 8.12 so its area equals $\\frac{7 * 8.12}{2} = 28.42$.

The lengths of the AB and the BC sides are 15.58 and 5.19, so the area of the rectangle is $15.58 * 5.19 = 80.86$. The length of the side of the equilateral triangle is the same as the side of the rectangle with length 5.19 so $area = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} * 5.19^2}{4} = \\frac{1.73 * 26.94}{4} = \\frac{46.61}{4} = 11.65$.

The perimeter of the shape is 42 so $2 * OtherSide + 3 * 6 = 42$. So $2 * OtherSide = 42 - 18 = 24$ and the length of the AB side is $\\frac{24}{2} = 12$. The area of the ABCD rectangle is 66 and the length of its AB side is 12, so the length of the AD side is $\\frac{66}{12} = 5.5$. Therefore the final answer is 5.5."}
{"label": "54.4", "question": "If ABC is a right triangle with ACB being the right angle, the BCDEF shape is constructed by adding an equilateral triangle BFE to the BE side of a BCDE rectangle, the length of the CD side is 7, the perimeter of the BCDEF shape is 60, we have a blue semi-circle with AC being the diameter and the area of the blue semi-circle is 56.52, compute the perimeter of the ABC right triangle. Assume $\\pi=3.14$. Round computations to 2 decimal places.", "cot": "The side of the equilateral triangle in the BCDEF shape is equal to the side of the rectangle with length 7 so the shape has two rectangle sides with equal but unknown lengths, one rectangle side with length 7, and two triangle sides with length 7. The perimeter of the BCDEF shape is 60 so $2 * UnknownSide + 3 * 7 = 60$. So $2 * UnknownSide = 60 - 21 = 39$, and the length of the BC side is $\\frac{39}{2} = 19.5$. The area of the blue semi-circle is 56.52 so the length of the AC diameter can be computed as $\\sqrt{\\frac{8 * 56.52}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{452.16}{3.14}} = \\sqrt{144.0} = 12$. The lengths of the AC and BC sides of the ABC triangle are 12 and 19.5, so the length of the hypotenuse (the AB side) is $\\sqrt{12^2 + 19.5^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 380.25} = \\sqrt{524.25} = 22.9$. The perimeter of the ABC triangle is $12 + 19.5 + 22.9 = 54.4$. Therefore the final answer is 54.4."}
{"label": "23.59", "question": "If the ABCD shape is a rectangle where the AD side is replaced with a semi-circle arc facing out (i.e. a rectangle plus a semi-circle), the perimeter of the ABCD shape is 96, BCF is a triangle, the length of the BF side is 17, the length of the CF side is 9 and the perimeter of the BCF triangle is 45, compute the length of the AB side of the ABCD shape. Assume $\\pi=3.14$. Round computations to 2 decimal places.", "cot": "The lengths of the BF and CF sides of the BCF triangle are 17 and 9 and the perimeter is 45, so the lengths of the BC side equals $45 - 17 - 9 = 19$. The perimeter of the ABCD shape is 96 and the length of the BC side is 19, so $2 * OtherSide + 19 + \\frac{19 * 3.14}{2} = 96$. So $2 * OtherSide = 96 - 19 - \\frac{19 * 3.14}{2} = 96 - 19 - \\frac{59.66}{2} = 96 - 19 - 29.83 = 47.17$. Therefore, the length of the AB side is $\\frac{47.17}{2} = 23.59$. Therefore the final answer is 23.59."}
