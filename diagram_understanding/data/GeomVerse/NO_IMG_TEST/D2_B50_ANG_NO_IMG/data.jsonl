The length of the hypotenuse of the CFG triangle is 20 and the length of the side opposite to the GCF angle is 15, so the GCF angle equals $\\arcsin(\\frac{15}{20}) = \\arcsin(0.75) = 48.59$. The angle BCA is vertical to the angle GCF so the degree of the BCA angle = 48.59. The degrees of the BAC and the BCA angles of the ABC triangle are 61.64 and 48.59, so the degree of the CBA angle $= 180 - 61.64 - 48.59 = 69.77$. Therefore the final answer is 69.77."}
