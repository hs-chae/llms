For the ABCDE shape, the length of the AB side of the rectangle is 23 and its other side can be computed based on the height of the equilateral triangle as $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} * 20 = \\frac{2}{1.73} * 20 = 1.16 * 20 = 23.2$. So the ABCDE shape has two rectangle sides with length 23, one rectangle side with length 23.2, and two triangle sides with length 23.2 so its perimeter becomes $2 * 23 + 3 * 23.2 = 46 + 69.6 = 115.6$. Therefore the final answer is 115.6."}

The ABCD shape has two sides with length 14.21, one with length 9, and a semi-circle arc with a diameter equal to the side of the rectangle with length 9.

The DAB angle has a complementary angle with degree 30 so the degree of the DAB angle is 90 - 30 = 60.

To compute the area of the ABCD shape, we can compute the area of the rectangle and subtract the area of the semi-circle. The lengths of the AB and the BC sides are 21 and 16, so the area of the rectangle is $21 * 16 = 336$.
