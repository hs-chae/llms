The length of the other side of the rectangle is equal to the length of the side of the triangle and can be computed based on the height of the triangle as $\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} * 7 = \\frac{2}{1.73} * 7 = 1.16 * 7 = 8.12$. So the area of the rectangle is $12.24 * 8.12 = 99.39$. The length of the height of the equilateral triangle is 7 and the length of the base was computed as 8.12 so its area equals $\\frac{7 * 8.12}{2} = 28.42$.

Round computations to 2 decimal places.", "cot": "The degrees of the BAE and the BEA angles of the ABE triangle are 30 and 45, so the degree of the ABE angle $= 180 - 30 - 45 = 105$. For the ABE triangle the length of the AE side is 16 and its opposite angle is 105 so the ratio is $\\frac{16}{sin(105)} = \\frac{16}{0.97} = 16.49$. The degree of the angle opposite to the AB side is equal to 45 so its length can be computed as $16.49 * \\sin(45) = 16.49 * 0.71 = 11.71$. The perimeter of the ABCD parallelogram is 36 and the length of its AB side is 11.71 so the length of the AD side is $\\frac{36}{2} - 11.71 = 18.0 - 11.71 = 6.29$.

The diameter of the semi-circle in the BCGH shape is equal to the side of the rectangle with length 9 so the shape has two sides with equal but unknown lengths, one side with length 9, and one semi-circle arc with diameter 9. So the perimeter is $2 * UnknownSide + 9 + \\frac{9 * \\pi}{2}$. So $2 * UnknownSide + 9 + \\frac{9 * 3.14}{2} = 58$.

To compute the area of the ABCD shape, we can compute the area of the rectangle and add the area of the semi-circle to it. The lengths of the AB and the BC sides of the ABCD shape are 24.61 and 17.43, so the area of the rectangle part is $24.61 * 17.43 = 428.95$. The diameter of the semi-circle is the same as the side of the rectangle with length 17.43 so $area = \\frac{3.14 * 17.43^2}{8} = \\frac{3.14 * 303.8}{8} = \\frac{953.93}{8} = 119.24$.
