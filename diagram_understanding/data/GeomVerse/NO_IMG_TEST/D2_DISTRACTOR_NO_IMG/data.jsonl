The perimeter of the BCFGH shape is 78 so $2 * UnknownSide + 3 * 14 = 78$. So $2 * UnknownSide = 78 - 42 = 36$, and the length of the BC side is $\\frac{36}{2} = 18$. The side of the equilateral triangle in the ABCDE shape is equal to the side of the rectangle with length 18 and the shape has two rectangle sides with equal but unknown lengths, one rectangle side with length 18, and two triangle sides with length 18. The perimeter of the shape is 102 so $2 * OtherSide + 3 * 18 = 102$. So $2 * OtherSide = 102 - 54 = 48$ and the length of the AB side is $\\frac{48}{2} = 24$. Therefore the final answer is 24."}
{"label": "30.54", "question": "If ABCD is a square where a circle has been removed from its center, the circle has the same diameter as the side of the square, AEFD is a square, the diagonal of the AEFD square is 17 and the length of the AD side is 12.06, compute the area of the ABCD shape.

The length of the AD side of the ABCD shape is 12.06, so its area is $12.06^2 - \\frac{\\pi}{4} * (12.06^2) = 145.44 - 0.79 * 145.44 = 145.44 - 114.9 = 30.54$. Therefore the final answer is 30.54."}

The area of the ABCD rectangle is 66 and the length of its AB side is 12, so the length of the AD side is $\\frac{66}{12} = 5.5$. Therefore the final answer is 5.5."}
{"label": "19.8", "question": "If the ABCD shape is a rectangle where the AD side is replaced with a semi-circle arc facing out (i.e. a rectangle plus a semi-circle), the perimeter of the ABCD shape is 76, the BCFGH shape is constructed by removing an equilateral triangle BHG from the BG side of a BCFG rectangle, the length of the CF side is 12, the area of the BCFGH shape is 108 and the length of the BC side is 14.16, compute the length of the AB side of the ABCD shape. Assume $\\pi=3.14$.

Therefore, the length of the BC side is $\\frac{169.92}{12} = 14.16$. The perimeter of the ABCD shape is 76 and the length of the BC side is 14.16, so $2 * OtherSide + 14.16 + \\frac{14.16 * 3.14}{2} = 76$.

We know the lengths of the AB, AC and BC sides of the ABC triangle are 23 and 13 and 22.85, so the semi-perimeter equals $(23 + 13 + 22.85) / 2 = 29.43$. So the area is $\\sqrt{29.43 * (29.43-23) * (29.43-13) * (29.43-22.85)} = \\sqrt{29.43 * 6.43 * 16.43 * 6.58} = \\sqrt{20458.07} = 143.03$. Therefore the final answer is 143.03."}
