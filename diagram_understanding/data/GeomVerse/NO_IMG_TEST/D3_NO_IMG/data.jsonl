The FAB angle has a complementary angle with degree 65 so the degree of the FAB angle is 90 - 65 = 25. The length of the AF side of the AFGB parallelogram is 20, the area is 96 and the FAB angle is 25.

So the perimeter is $2 * UnknownSide + 7.6 + \\frac{7.6 * \\pi}{2}$. So $2 * UnknownSide + 7.6 + \\frac{7.6 * 3.14}{2} = 38$. So $2 * UnknownSide = 38 - 7.6 - \\frac{7.6 * 3.14}{2} = 38 - 7.6 - \\frac{23.86}{2} = 38 - 7.6 - 11.93 = 18.47$. Therefore, the length of the AC side is $\\frac{18.47}{2} = 9.23$. For the ABC triangle, we know the length of the AC base is 9.23 and its corresponding height is 14. We also know the corresponding height for the AB base is equal to 9. Therefore, the length of the AB base is equal to $\\frac{9.23 * 14}{9} = \\frac{129.22}{9} = 14.36$. Therefore the final answer is 14.36."}

The degree of the angle opposite to the AB side is equal to 75 so its length can be computed as $25.61 * \\sin(75) = 25.61 * 0.97 = 24.84$. The lengths of the AB and the AD sides of the ABCD parallelogram are 24.84 and 10 and the area is 114 so the sine of the BAD angle is $\\frac{114}{24.84 * 10} = 0.46$ and so the angle in degrees is $\\arcsin(0.46) = 27.39$.

The area of the ACDEF shape is 114 and the length of the CD side of its rectangle is 7.7, so $OtherSide * 7.7 + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} * 7.7^2 = 114$, so $OtherSide * 7.7 = 114 - \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} * 7.7^2 = 114 - \\frac{1.73}{4} * 59.29 = 114 - 0.43 * 59.29 = 114 - 25.49 = 88.51$. Therefore, the length of the AC side is $\\frac{88.51}{7.7} = 11.49$. For the ABC triangle, the lengths of the AB and AC sides are 19 and 11.49 and the degree of the angle between them is 35.
